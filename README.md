# Landscape-Classification
<h4> Transfer Learning on Inception v3 model using TensorFlow </h4>

I had a really small dataset (130 instances per class) of 4 types of landscape: <b>Beach, Mountains, City, Forest</b>

The most suitable approach was transfer learning. The model I used was Inception v3, which is trained on over 1M images from over 1000 classes.
